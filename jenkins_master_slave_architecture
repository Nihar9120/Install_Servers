Working with Master and Slave Architecture:
===========================================
step-1:

create Jenkins master:
======================
1.create ec2 instance
2.connect ec2 using mobaxterm
3.install git client
4.install java software
5.install Jenkins server
6.add git, jdk and maven plugins
7.enable jenkins port number in sequrity group 
8.Access Jenkins server in browser and login

step-2:

create Jenkins slave:
=====================
1.create ec2 instance
2.connect ec2 using mobaxterm
3.install git client
4.install java software
5.create one directory in /home/ec2-user (ex:slavenode)

step-3:

Configure slave in Jenkins server:
==================================
1.go to Jenkins dashboard
2.go to manage Jenkins 
3.go to manage Jenkins nodes and clouds
4.click on 'new node' -->enter node name -->select permanent agent
5.enter remote root directory (/home/ec2-user/slavenode)
6.enter label name as slave-1
7.select lunch method as 'lunch agents via ssh'
8.give host as 'slave vm dns url'
9.add credentials (select kind as : ssh username with private key)
10.enter user-name as: ec2-user
11.select private as enter directly and add private key

note:open gitbash from your .pem file location and execute below command to get private key from pem file
     $cat <.pem file name>

note:it will display private key on git bash terminal(just copy and paste in jenkins)

12.select host key strategy as 'manually trusted key verification strategy'
13.click on apply and save(we can see configure slave)

-->with the above steps master and slave configuration completed 
-->go to Jenkins server and create Jenkins job

note:under generation section of job creation process, select "restrict where this project can run" and enter slave-1 label name and finish job creation.

-->execute the job using "build now" option

note:job will be executed on slavenode(go to job console o/p and verify execution details.)
